# How to use Save States

1. Press the button assigned to FN1 on your Controller to Save the current State of the game - F2 on your Keyboard also works.

2. Press FN2 on your Controller to load the previously saved Game State.

* Pressing F1 resets the loaded save state and thus FN2 will go back to reseting to Round Start Position as normal.
* Long Pressing F1 will also clear the "Max Damage" value under the Attack Display menu.

# Notes

Detailed information on color codes will be added to this post later.

Note that the "FirstActive" value corresponds to the frame on which a hitbox connects with the opponent and is not necessarily accurate to a move's first active frame.

The FirstActive value is also currently inaccurate if the attacker does not incur hitstop (projectiles, hitgrabs, command grabs).
